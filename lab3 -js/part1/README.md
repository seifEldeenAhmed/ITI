# JavaScript Browser-Based Tasks

This repository contains tasks that involve JavaScript code to interact with users via prompts in a web browser environment.

## Lab1: Login

### Objective
Write JavaScript code that prompts the user for a username and password. Validate the input against predefined credentials ("admin" and "421$$"). If the provided credentials are correct, display a success message. If incorrect, specify which data was entered incorrectly.

### Instructions
1. Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `lab1_login.js`.
2. Use `prompt()` to request the user's username and password.
3. Implement conditional statements to check if the entered credentials match the predefined values.
4. Display appropriate messages based on the validation results.

## Lab2: Calculator

### Objective
Develop a JavaScript-based calculator that interacts with the user through prompts. Prompt the user for two numbers and an operation (sum, multiply, subtract, divide, modulus). Perform the operation and display the result to the user.

### Instructions
1. Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `lab2_calc.js`.
2. Use `prompt()` to gather the first number, operation type, and second number.
3. Implement logic to perform the specified operation on the given numbers.
4. Display the result to the user using `alert()` or `console.log()`.

## Bonus Task: Extended Calculator Features

### Objective
Extend the calculator functionality from Lab2. Allow users to perform a series of operations using the last result as a starting point. For instance, the user can continually perform operations using the previous result.

### Instructions
1. Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `bonus_calculator.js`.
2. Use `prompt()` to gather the first number and operation type.
3. Implement a loop that enables users to continuously input operations using the previous result.
4. Display the intermediate and final results to the user using `alert()` or `console.log()`.

**Note**: Ensure appropriate error handling and validation for user inputs across all tasks.
